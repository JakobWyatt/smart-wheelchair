  abstract = {End-to-end Network has become increasingly important in multi-tasking. One prominent example of this is the growing significance of a driving perception system in autonomous driving. This paper systematically studies an end-to-end perception network for multi-tasking and proposes several key optimizations to improve accuracy. First, the paper proposes efficient segmentation head and box/class prediction networks based on weighted bidirectional feature network. Second, the paper proposes automatically customized anchor for each level in the weighted bidirectional feature network. Third, the paper proposes an efficient training loss function and training strategy to balance and optimize network. Based on these optimizations, we have developed an end-to-end perception network to perform multi-tasking, including traffic object detection, drivable area segmentation and lane detection simultaneously, called HybridNets, which achieves better accuracy than prior art. In particular, HybridNets achieves 77.3 mean Average Precision on Berkeley DeepDrive Dataset, outperforms lane detection with 31.6 mean Intersection Over Union with 12.83 million parameters and 15.6 billion floating-point operations. In addition, it can perform visual perception tasks in real-time and thus is a practical and accurate solution to the multi-tasking problem.

  abstract = {Path planning is a fundamental capability for autonomous navigation of robotic wheelchairs. With the impressive development of deep-learning technologies, imitation learning-based path planning approaches have achieved effective results in recent years. However, the disadvantages of these approaches are twofold: 1) they may need extensive time and labor to record expert demonstrations as training data},

  abstract = {This paper presents further improvements on the earlier vector field histogram (VFH) method developed by Borenstein-Koren (1991) for real-time mobile robot obstacle avoidance. The enhanced method, called VFH+, offers several improvements that result in smoother robot trajectories and greater reliability. VFH+ reduces some of the parameter tuning of the original VFH method by explicitly compensating for the robot width. Also added in VFH+ is a better approximation of the mobile robot trajectory, which results in higher reliability.},
