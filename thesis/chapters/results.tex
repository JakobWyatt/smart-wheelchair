This thesis project has involved implementation and evaluation
of many different components to create an end-to-end wheelchair
navigation assistance system.

\subsection{Evaluation of machine learning models on preliminary dataset}
%include speed 

\subsection{Transfer learning on Hybridnets model to improve performance}
% do this first

\subsection{Identification of suitable driving paths using segmentation}
% transformation, morphology

\subsection{Identification of static obstacles using 3D point cloud data}
% sensor tilt, find_floor_plane

\subsection{Evaluation of semi-autonomous assistive wheelchair control algorithm}
% VFH+

\subsection{Comparison and implementation of wheelchair movement tracking algorithms}
% positional tracking API
