\section*{ABSTRACT}
This progress report involves the identification and definition of the core thesis problem;
creating a semi-autonomous wheelchair that prioritises user safety and independence.
A literature review details prior work in this field, and identifies potential algorithms
for scene recognition and assistive control. Additionally, the literature review identifies and evaluates
sensors that could be used to perceive the wheelchairs environment.

A preliminary wheelchair driving video dataset has been collected around Curtin university.
This dataset has been used to evaluate algorithms such as YOLOv5, DeepLabv3, and Hybridnet on
the problem of scene recognition, with promising results. VFH+ has been evaluated as an assistive
control algorithm after being implemented in MATLAB. Additionally, sensors and hardware to be used
alongside the wheelchair have been identified and evaluated.

The methodology and technical roadmap of this project have been planned, and future work identified (to be completed
next semester). This involves the collection of a second dataset using the final sensors, retraining of
scene recognition models, and final integration of the semi-autonomous system with the wheelchair.
