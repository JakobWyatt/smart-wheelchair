%Time should be allocated to thesis writing and review as well as technical progress.
%A Gantt chart displaying the expected progress over the course of the two semesters
%is shown in \cref{fig:gantt_chart}. Note that a significant portion of time at the beginning was allocated
%to initial research and project scope. Due to the large number of students working on this team,
%a clear project scope was important so that students did not unnecessarily duplicate work.
